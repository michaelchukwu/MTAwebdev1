I'm glad you're going through the tutorial. It sounds like what's happening is you've created your new branch on GitHub, but you haven't made changes (commits) on that branch or pushed your local changes (commits) onto GitHub. \r\n\r\nWhat you can do is:\r\n1. Make sure you're working on the correct branch (use the 'git branch' command). There should be an asterisk next to your branch name you're currently working on.\r\n2. Make sure you've made commits on your branch. You can use the 'git status' command to see if there are any unsaved changes (You want it to say 'On branch my-branch-name\r\nnothing to commit, working directory clean'). You can use the 'git log' command to make sure that you have made commits on that branch. You'll need to make at least one commit for there to be differences to appear.\r\n3. Finally once you're sure you've made a commit on that branch, try redoing the 'git push origin my-branch-name' command and refresh the page on GitHub. You should then your changes listed in your branch on GitHub.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, let me know if you run into any problems!","userUrl":"","state":"APPROVED","userIp":null,"userReferrer":null,"userAgent":null,"contentAuthorEmail":null,"contentAuthorName":null,"contentCreatedAt":0,"threadId":"0002.0001.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000","replyingTo":null,"parentId":0,"legacyId":0,"extraContext":null,"parent":null},{"id":389399501,"portalId":0,"contentId":0,"contentTitle":"","contentPermalink":null,"collectionId":0,"createdAt":1450142649246,"deletedAt":0,"userName":"June","firstName":"June","lastName":"","userEmail":null,"comment":"Hi Meghan, \r\nThanks for the answer.
